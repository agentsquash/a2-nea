	1. Copy your code (ensure it has comments)
	2. It can be presented as an overview guide, including:
		a. directing the marker to the particularly more sophisticated algorithms
		b. explanations of particularly difficult-to-understand code sections; a careful division of the presentation of the code listing into appropriately labelled sections to make navigation as easy as possible for the marker.
	3. Highlight where you have used Group A/B technical skills (pg. 95-96 spec)
Highlight where you have used excellent coding styles (pg. 97 spec)
