# Analysis

## Investigation
### Introduction to Client
Mr Kevin Ashley is the managing director of Ashley Quality Improvement Services, a company that provides consultancy services for drug manufacture in the pharmaceutical industry. His role involves frequent travel around the UK and the EU, with schedules often changing to suit client needs. As such, he makes frequent use of public transport methods such as air and rail travel. However, during this travel he is often disrupted due to delays (particularly in the UK), which reduces billable hours as time is spent having to find alternative route options - and as such has asked myself to attempt a program that would be able to dynamically reroute his journey as a result of delays.

### The Problem

## Interview with Client
**What system do you currently use for travelling during disruption?**

**What benefits does your current system have?**

**What are the drawbacks of your current system?**

**Are there any particular features you feel are essential to a new system (must haves)?**

**Are there any features that you feel would improve the system but do not require? (nice to haves)**

**How would you envisage using this new system? (web app / mobile app?)**

**Do you envisage a need to connect this system with other corporate services?**

**Is there anything else you would like to add?**

### Current Solution
At the moment, Mr Ashley plans his rail journeys in the UK using the mobile 'Trainline' app, booking his tickets prior to the journey. Due to his busy schedule, he often does not have the time to check the status of his full journey, often realising delays upon reaching the station or while on the train itself. This is disruptive to his workflow - where he often has to keep in touch with the client and other contractors while travelling. If a delay is sufficient enough to cause a missed connection, then it is often the case that he has to replan his journey at each station where he changes. Where possible, he may be able to replan his journey using the 'Trainline' app itself - however, this does not take into account the real time nature of delays experienced on the rail network and typically provides a poor user experience - as the journey planning experience on most platforms is orientated towards those who are planning a whole journey rather than rerouting as a result of disruption. This causes disruption to his workflow due to the focus required for tasks in his role, reducing productivity and potentially billable hours.

**Key Points:**
- Finds out about delays typically upon arrival at the station
- Due to the real time nature of delays, difficult to reroute journey to ensure earliest arrival time.
- Poor user experience on current platforms (Trainline, NRE)
