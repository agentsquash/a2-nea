	1. Copy and paste the objectives and say whether they were successful or not
	2. You need to obtain independent feedback on how well the outcome meets its requirements and discuss this feedback.
		a. Some of this feedback could be generated during prototyping. If so, this feedback, and how/ why it was taken account must be presented and referenced so it can be found easily. 
	3. You should also consider and discuss how your solution could be improved more realistically if the problem/investigation were to be revisited or extended.
	4. Analysis of feedback from the third party who was involved at the analysis stage.

Key questions:
	• Has the student given consideration as to how well the outcome meets the initial requirement?
	• Has the student reflected on the objectives originally set and considered how their solution measures up to those objectives?
Has the student obtained independent feedback and reflected upon this?
