## Client
Mr Kevin Ashley is the managing director of Ashley Quality Improvement Services, a company that provides consultancy services for drug manufacture in the pharmaceutical industry. His role involves frequent travel around the UK and the EU, with schedules often changing to suit client needs. As such, he makes frequent use of public transport methods such as air and rail travel. However, during this travel he is often disrupted due to delays (particularly in the UK), which reduces billable hours as time is spent having to find alternative route options - and as such has asked myself to attempt a program that would be able to dynamically reroute his journey as a result of delays.

## Current System

At the moment, Mr Ashley plans his rail journeys in the UK using the mobile 'Trainline' app, booking his tickets prior to the journey. Due to his busy schedule, he often does not have the time to check the status of his full journey, often realising delays upon reaching the station or while on the train itself. This is disruptive to his workflow - where he often has to keep in touch with the client and other contractors while travelling. If a delay is sufficient enough to cause a missed connection, then it is often the case that he has to replan his journey at each station where he changes. Where possible, he may be able to replan his journey using the 'Trainline' app itself - however, this does not take into account the real time nature of delays experienced on the rail network and typically provides a poor user experience - as the journey planning experience on most platforms is orientated towards those who are planning a whole journey rather than rerouting as a result of disruption. This causes disruption to his workflow due to the focus required for tasks in his role, reducing productivity and potentially billable hours.

**Key Points:**
- Finds out about delays typically upon arrival at the station
- Due to the real time nature of delays, difficult to reroute journey to ensure earliest arrival time.
- Poor user experience on current platforms (Trainline, NRE)

## Additional research

API - SOAP (which is how the NRE Darwin API is provided) is particularly outdated. Find a JSON alternative if possible? (Done - Huxley)

UWA - how do these work? Researching in spare time...

Using the National Rail API itself - how does this work in the scope of dynamically calculating efficient routings? >> Need to look into getting Journey Planner access.
>> Journey planner access comes at a cost. Look into a free alternative.
