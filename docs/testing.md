	1. Use the test plan from the design section and complete the tests showing corrections where necessary (must include screenshots of them working/not working)
		a. demonstrate the robustness of the complete, or nearly complete, solution/thoroughness of investigation and which demonstrate that the requirements of the solution/investigation have been achieved.
		b. must include normal, erroneous and boundary tests
	2. Explain the tests that were carried out alongside the evidence for them (so when you had errors in your code and how you fixed them)
	3. Possibly hand back to end user and get their feedback
	4. This can be in the form of a testing table with screenshot evidence or a screen recording with your program running and you talking through the tests (they will still need to be documented and reference to timestamps in the video).

Key questions:
	• Does the section demonstrate that thorough testing has been carried out?
	• Have the core requirements been tested?
Is there evidence that the more technically challenging parts of the project have been tested?
